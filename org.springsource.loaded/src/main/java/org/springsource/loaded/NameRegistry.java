 * loaded in two places (by different classloaders), it will have the same number in both. Only one of those a/b/C types will be
 * visible at the location in question, the tricky part could be working out which one (if classloaders are being naughty) but in
 * theory the first time we get confused (due to finding the name twice), we can work out which one is right and use that mapping
 * from then on.
